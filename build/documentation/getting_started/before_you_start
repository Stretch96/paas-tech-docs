<p>Before it can start using the platform, your department, agency or team must accept the Terms of Use during account activation.</p>

<p>To be hosted on GOV.UK PaaS, your app must:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>follow the <a href="architecture.html#12-factor-application-principles">twelve-factor application principles</a>; this will be true if your app has been written so it can deploy to another PaaS like Heroku</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a href="deploying_apps.html#data-security-classification">store data classified up to ‘official’</a>; your app cannot store data classified as 'secret' or 'top secret'</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="deploying_apps.html#buildpacks">Cloud Foundry buildpacks</a> provide runtime and framework support for your application. For most languages, you will need to provide configuration files to describe your app’s dependencies. Most buildpacks will support a limited range of versions of the language.</p>
