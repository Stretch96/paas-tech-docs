<p>GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud-hosting platform built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). GOV.UK PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you donâ€™t need to hire people with specialist cloud skills.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK PaaS is hosted in two regions, London and Ireland.</p>

<p>GOV.UK PaaS is a live service.</p>

<p>GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry</a> project, and runs on Amazon Web Services. <a href="https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/17/choosing-cloudfoundry/">Read our blog post on why we chose Cloud Foundry</a> for more information.
