<h1 id="amazon-sqs">Amazon SQS</h1><p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) offers a durable hosted queue that lets you
build decoupled distributed software components.</p>
<p>This is a beta service which is currently in a testing phase. If you would like to test the service, contact the GOV.UK PaaS team at <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="provision-an-amazon-web-service-sqs-queue">Provision an Amazon Web Service SQS queue</h3><p>Creating a service instance provisions an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Queue
Service (SQS) queue.</p>
<p>The name of the service overall is <code>aws-sqs-queue</code>.</p>
<p>There are two types of plan available for the service:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>standard</code>, providing at-least-once delivery,
where each message is delivered at least once</li>
<li><code>fifo</code>, for first-in-first-out queues providing <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing">exactly-once processing</a>,
where each message is delivered once and remains available until a
consumer processes it and deletes it</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS SQS queues can be configured to move messages that cannot be successfully
processed by your application on a secondary queue, known as a
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html">dead-letter queue</a>,
letting you isolate problematic messages to determine why their processing did not succeed.</p>
<h4 id="provision-a-standard-aws-sqs-queue">Provision a standard AWS SQS queue</h4><p>Use a standard queue when the order of the items on your queue is not
important and when your application can tolerate occasional duplication of
messages.</p>
<p>Run the following in the command line to provision a standard AWS SQS queue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf create-service aws-sqs-queue standard SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div><p>It will take between 1 and 5 minutes to set up the service instance. To check
its progress run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf service SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue.</p>
<h4 id="provision-a-fifo-aws-sqs-queue">Provision a FIFO AWS SQS queue</h4><p>Use a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue when the order of operations and events
is critical, or where duplicates cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>Run the following in the command line to provision a FIFO AWS SQS queue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf create-service aws-sqs-queue fifo SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div><p>It will take between 1 and 5 minutes to set up the service instance. To check
its progress run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf service SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue.</p>
<h3 id="bind-an-aws-sqs-queue-to-your-app">Bind an AWS SQS queue to your app</h3><p>You must bind the SQS queue to your app so you can get credentials to use the
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sqs/">AWS SQS API</a> to read
from and write to the queue.</p>
<p>You can bind an SQS queue using the command line or the manifest file.</p>
<p>Run the following to bind an SQS queue to your app:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div><p>It will take between 1 and 5 minutes to set up the binding. To check its progress, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf service SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div><p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>APP_NAME</code> is the name of a deployed instance of your app, as specified in your app&rsquo;s manifest or push command</li>
<li><code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue</li>
</ul>
<p>When binding an SQS service to your app, you have the option of restricting the
queue permissions given to that app. You can control this using <code>bind-service</code>&lsquo;s <code>-c</code>
flag to set the bind parameters <code>access_policy</code> JSON key, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME -c '{"access_policy": "consumer"}'
</code></pre></div><p>The currently supported <code>access_policy</code> values are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>full</code>, which means the default, full access permissions</li>
<li><code>producer</code>, which is appropriate for an app that will be sending messages to the queue,
but does not need to be able to read or delete messages</li>
<li><code>consumer</code>, which is appropriate for an app that will be reading and possibly deleting messages,
but does not need to be able to send messages to the queue</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_apps.html#deploying-public-apps">app&rsquo;s manifest</a>
to bind an SQS queue to the app (with default <code>full</code> permissions only).
It will bind automatically when you next deploy your app. An example manifest:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>--
applications:
- name: APP_NAME
  services:
  - SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="use-the-service">Use the service</h2>
<h3 id="connect-to-an-sqs-queue-from-your-app">Connect to an SQS queue from your app</h3><p>Restart your app to populate your <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> <a href="/deploying_apps.html#system-provided-environment-variables">environment variable</a>
with the credentials needed to connect to the SQS queue.</p>
<p>An example <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> environment variable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "aws-sqs-queue": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "aws_access_key_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "aws_region": "eu-west-2",
     "aws_secret_access_key": "XXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "primary_queue_url": "https://XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "secondary_queue_url": "https://XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    },
    "instance_name": "my-queue",
    "label": "aws-sqs-queue",
    "name": "my-queue",
    "plan": "standard",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "sqs"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}
</code></pre></div><p>You must pass credentials from your <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> environment variable to
your AWS software development kit (SDK). Use the appropriate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/#sdks">Amazon SDK
documentation</a>, and extract the
credentials from VCAP_SERVICES to provide to the SDK. You can usually do this
either by setting environment variables such as <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code>,
<code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> or <code>AWS_REGION</code>, or by providing the SDK with the right
static credentials function call or data as part of your app.</p>
<p>You should use the provided <code>primary_queue_url</code> in AWS API calls to make use of
the queue.</p>
<p>Your app may also connect to a second, separate, queue using the <code>secondary_queue_url</code>
value, but we recommend ignoring this value unless you are configuring a
dead-letter queue. See <a href="#configuring-a-dead-letter-queue">configuring a dead letter queue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="amend-the-service">Amend the service</h2>
<h3 id="updating-an-aws-sqs-queue">Updating an AWS SQS queue</h3><h4 id="setting-a-message-retention-period">Setting a message retention period</h4><p>Messages that have not been consumed by your application will eventually expire
and be removed from the queue.</p>
<p>The default retention period is 4 days.
The maximum allowed retention period is 14 days.</p>
<p>To configure the time that messages are kept on the queue, we can update the
service, specifying the period in seconds:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"message_retention_period": 345600}'
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and <code>345600</code> is
the message retention period in seconds. You can also pass this parameter at
service creation time.</p>
<h4 id="setting-a-message-delay">Setting a message delay</h4><p>The time in seconds for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed.</p>
<p>The default delay is 0 seconds.
The maximum allowed delay is 15 minutes (900 seconds).</p>
<p>To configure the time that messages are delayed we can update the
service, specifying the period in seconds:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"delay_seconds": 600}'
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and <code>600</code> is
the message delay period in seconds. You can also pass this parameter at
service creation time.</p>
<h4 id="setting-a-maximum-message-size">Setting a maximum message size</h4><p>The limit of how many bytes that a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.</p>
<p>The minimum maximum message size is 1,204 bytes (1 KiB).
The maximum and default maximum message size is 262,144 bytes (256 KiB).</p>
<p>To configure the maximum message size for the queue we can update the
service, specifying the size in bytes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"maximum_message_size": 245600}'
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and <code>245600</code> is
a size in bytes to allow on the queue. You can also pass this parameter at
service creation time.</p>
<h4 id="setting-a-receive-message-wait-time">Setting a receive message wait time</h4><p>Specifies the duration, in seconds, that the ReceiveMessage action call waits until
a message is in the queue in order to include it in the response, rather than
returning an empty response if a message is not yet available.</p>
<p>The minimum receive message wait time is 0 seconds.
The maximum receive message wait time is 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Short polling is used as the default or when you specify 0 for this property.
For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html">Amazon SQS Long Poll documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To configure the receive wait time for the queue we can update the
service, specifying the period in seconds:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"receive_message_wait_time_seconds": 20}'
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and <code>20</code> is
a period in seconds to wait for messages for. You can also pass this parameter at
service creation time.</p>
<h4 id="setting-a-message-visibility-timeout">Setting a message visibility timeout</h4><p>The length of time during which a message will be unavailable after a message is
delivered from the queue. This blocks other components from receiving the same
message and gives the initial component time to process and delete the message
from the queue.</p>
<p>The minimum visibility timeout is 0 seconds.
The default visibility timeout is 30 seconds.
The maximum visibility timeout is 12 hours (43,200 seconds).</p>
<p>To configure the visibility timeout for the queue we can update the
service, specifying the period in seconds:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"visibility_timeout": 34560}'
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and <code>34560</code> is
the message retention period in seconds. You can also pass this parameter at
service creation time.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-a-dead-letter-queue">Configuring a dead-letter queue</h4><p>Sometimes, your application may not be able to process a message from your
primary queue. When this happens it is useful to move messages onto a
secondary queue so they can be investigated later without interfering with the
correct operation of your primary queue.</p>
<p>When your service is configured in this pattern we call the secondary queue a
&ldquo;dead-letter&rdquo; queue. To set up this pattern we can configure the number of times
a message is allowed to appear on the primary queue before it is redirected to
the secondary queue.</p>
<p>Run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"redrive_max_receive_count": 3}'
</code></pre></div><p>where <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and <code>3</code> is the
number of attempts a message should have on the primary queue before being
redirected to the secondary queue. You can also pass this parameter at service
creation time.</p>
<p>When you bind an app to an AWS SQS queue service instance, you will find credentials for two unique queue URLs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>primary_queue_url</code> is the URL for the main queue</li>
<li><code>secondary_queue_url</code> is the URL for the secondary queue, now acting as a dead-letter queue</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remove-the-service">Remove the service</h2>
<h3 id="unbind-an-sqs-queue-from-your-app">Unbind an SQS queue from your app</h3><p>Run the following in the command line to unbind the SQS queue from the app:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf unbind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div><p>It can take between 1 and 5 minutes to remove the binding. To check its progress, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf service SERVICE_NAME

<ul>
<li><code>APP_NAME</code> is the name of a deployed instance of your app, as specified in your app&rsquo;s manifest or push command</li>
<li><code>SERVICE_NAME</code> is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue</li>
</ul>
<p>If you unbind the SQS queue from your app but do not delete the queue, that
queue will persist even after you delete your app. You can re-bind or
re-connect to the queue in future.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-an-sqs-queue">Deleting an SQS queue</h3><p>Run the following in the command line to delete the SQS queue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf delete-service SERVICE_NAME
