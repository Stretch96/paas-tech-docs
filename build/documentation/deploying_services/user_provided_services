<h1 id="user-provided-backing-services">User-provided backing services</h1><p>You can use backing services that are not available in the Cloud Foundry marketplace by using a <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html">user-provided service instance</a>.</p>
<p>User-provided backing service instances have the same functionality as backing service instances available in the marketplace.</p>
