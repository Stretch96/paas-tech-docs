<h2 id="excluding-files">Excluding files</h2>

<p>Cloud Foundry is not version-control-aware, so <code>cf push</code> will deploy the working state of whatever files you have in that directory. In most cases, you will want to <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html#exclude">exclude files</a> ignored by Git. From within your project directory, run</p>

<p><code>
ln -s .gitignore .cfignore
</code></p>

<p>and commit the <code>.cfignore</code> to your repository. However, read on if you have a more advanced CF setup.</p>

<p>A couple of important points on the <code>.cfignore</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<p>if you have a more advanced app setup and have apps with a <code>path</code> other than the project root (where you run <code>cf push</code> from), you will need an additional <code>.cfignore</code> file located in each app <code>path</code>;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>also note that more advanced <code>.gitignore</code> syntax, such as the <code>**</code> recursive subdirectory wildcard, are <em>not</em> supported by <code>.cfignore</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
