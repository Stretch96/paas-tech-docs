<h2 id="failed-login-rate-limit">Failed login rate limit</h2>

<p>If your Cloud Foundry account makes too many failed login attempts within a short period of time, your account will be locked for security reasons. While the account is locked, even the correct login details will not work.</p>

<p>Wait 5 minutes without trying to log in for the lock to expire.</p>

<p>Make sure that no automated services (such as Jenkins) are trying to log in using your account during this time.</p>
