<h2 id="isolation-segments">Isolation segments</h2><h3 id="what-isolation-segments-are">What isolation segments are</h3><p>Cells are the underlying servers that build and run your apps.
GOV.UK PaaS schedules your apps on a large number of identical cells.</p>
<p>GOV.UK PaaS has other cells which are slightly different to the regular cells
on which your apps run. These cells are called isolation segments.</p>
<p>You can specify an isolation segments for a space, or for an organisation.</p>
<h4 id="apps-within-a-space">Apps within a space</h4><p>When you specify an isolation segment for a space, all apps in
that space run on the isolation segment&rsquo;s cells, rather than on the normal
cells.</p>
<h4 id="apps-within-an-organisation">Apps within an organisation</h4><p>When you specify an isolation segment for an organisation, all apps in
that organisation run on the isolation segment&rsquo;s cells, rather than on the
normal cells.</p>
<h3 id="what-isolation-segments-are-available">What isolation segments are available</h3><p>We currently offer one isolation segment:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>egress-restricted-1</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="egress-restricted">Egress restricted</h4><p>When your apps run in an egress restricted isolation segment, they can:</p>

<ul>
<li>serve traffic from the internet (if you map a <a href="/deploying_apps.html#names-routes-and-domains">public route</a>)</li>
<li>serve traffic internally (if you map a <a href="/deploying_apps.html#deploying-private-apps">private route</a>)</li>
<li>talk to other apps within the platform (if you set up <a href="/deploying_apps.html#create-a-network-policy">network policies</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, your apps cannot:</p>

<ul>
<li>talk to the internet</li>
<li>make external DNS requests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-you-can-use-isolation-segments">How you can use isolation segments</h3><p>If we have enabled an isolation segment for your organisation, and if you are
an org manager, you can change how your apps are scheduled using the
isolation segment.</p>
<p>For example, the following commands will create a new space and make sure that any app you push within that space will run on a cell with egress
restrictions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf create-space my-locked-down-space
cf set-space-isolation-segment my-locked-down-space egress-restricted-1
</code></pre></div><p>Contact us at
<a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>
if you would like us to enable an isolation segment for your organisation.</p>
