<h1 id="know-your-responsibilities">Know your responsibilities</h1><p>When you use the GOV.UK PaaS to host your app, both you and the GOV.UK PaaS team have responsibilities. These responsibilities change depending on whether you deploy your app using a:</p>

<ul>
<li>standard buildpack</li>
<li>custom buildpack</li>
<li>Docker image</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which buildpack or Docker image you use, the GOV.UK PaaS team is always responsible for keeping the infrastructure your app runs on secure.</p>
<h2 id="standard-buildpack-responsibilities">Standard buildpack responsibilities</h2><p>GOV.UK PaaS provides a set of <a href="/deploying_apps.html#buildpacks">standard buildpacks</a>. If you&rsquo;re new to working in the cloud or have a small development team, we recommend using a standard buildpack to deploy your app. This maximises the support you receive from GOV.UK PaaS.</p>
<p>If you use a standard buildpack, you’re responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping your app secure</li>
<li>making sure your app works with new buildpack versions</li>
<li>redeploying your app so your app uses the latest version of the standard buildpack</li>
</ul>
<p>The GOV.UK PaaS team is responsible for providing updates and security patches for the:</p>

<ul>
<li>build environment</li>
<li>language runtime</li>
<li>base operating system libraries</li>
<li>Linux kernel</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="custom-buildpack-responsibilities">Custom buildpack responsibilities</h2><p>A standard buildpack may not work for your app, for example if you want to use a language GOV.UK PaaS does not support. You can use a <a href="/deploying_apps.html#how-to-use-custom-buildpacks">custom buildpack</a> to deploy your app instead of a standard buildpack.</p>
<p>If you use a custom buildpack, you’re responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping your app secure</li>
<li>your custom buildpack&rsquo;s security, including your app&rsquo;s build environment and language runtime</li>
<li>making sure your app works with new operating system versions</li>
<li>redeploying your app so your app uses the latest operating system libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>The GOV.UK PaaS team is responsible for providing updates and security patches for the:</p>

<ul>
<li>base operating system libraries</li>
<li>Linux kernel</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="docker-image-responsibilities">Docker image responsibilities</h2><p>You can use a <a href="/deploying_apps.html#deploy-a-docker-image">Docker image</a> to deploy your app instead of a buildpack. You can do this if you are already running your app in a Docker image and are migrating your app to the GOV.UK PaaS.</p>
<p>If you use a Docker image, you’re responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping your app secure</li>
<li>your Docker image&rsquo;s security, including your app&rsquo;s build environment, language runtime and operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>The GOV.UK PaaS team is responsible for providing updates and security patches for the Linux kernel.</p>
<h2 id="custom-buildpacks-compared-to-docker-images">Custom buildpacks compared to Docker images</h2><p>Custom buildpacks have the following advantages over Docker images:</p>

<ul>
<li>custom buildpacks provide a standard way of building and staging apps</li>
<li>custom buildpacks do not depend on a Docker registry such as <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> being available</li>
<li>there is a large variety of open source custom buildpacks so your deployment pipeline does not need to include Docker image creation</li>
<li>buildpacks are designed for 12-factor apps whereas some Docker images may contain databases or other forms of storage that should be provisioned as an external backing service</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker images have the following advantages over custom buildpacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>the same Docker image can be run locally on developer machines or on any Linux-based machine</li>
<li>exactly the same Docker image can be promoted between environments as an immutable asset, rather than being rebuilt each time</li>
</ul>
