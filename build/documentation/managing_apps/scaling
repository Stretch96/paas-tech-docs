<h2 id="scaling">Scaling</h2>

<p>You can manually scale your app to meet increasing demand. You can do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>changing the number of app instances running</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>increasing memory and disk space allocated to your app</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your organisation <a href="/managing_apps.html#quotas">quotas</a> limit the resources you can use for each app.</p>

<h3 id="changing-the-number-of-app-instances">Changing the number of app instances</h3>

<p>You can change the number of instances of your app running at the same time. Running more than one app instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>allows your app to handle increased traffic and demand as incoming requests are automatically load-balanced across all instances</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>helps maintain high availability and makes it less likely that the failure of a single component will take down your app</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, run the following command to set the number of app instances to 5:</p>

<p><code>cf scale APPNAME -i 5</code></p>

<p>You can also use the manifest to set the number of instances that will start when you <a href="deploying_apps.html#deploying-public-apps">push the app</a>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>---
applications:
- name: APP_NAME
   instances: 2
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should always run more than one instance when <a href="/deploying_apps.html#deploy-an-app-to-production">deploying an app to production</a>.</p>

<h3 id="increasing-memory-or-disk-space">Increasing memory or disk space</h3>

<p>You can scale an app vertically by increasing the memory or disk space available to each instance of the app.</p>

<p>For example, this command increases the available memory for an app to 1 gigabyte:</p>

<p><code>cf scale APPNAME -m 1G</code></p>

<p>This command increases the disk space limit for an app to 512 megabytes:</p>

<p><code>cf scale APPNAME -k 512M</code></p>
