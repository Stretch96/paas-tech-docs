<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Right now, development teams spend considerable time and money setting up all the components required to host a government service. With GOV.UK PaaS, development teams can save on this effort by using a hosting stack that’s already been developed.</p>

<p>Your development team can use PaaS to deploy and run government applications written in a range of languages and web frameworks. You’ll need to push your source code to the PaaS environment and the code will be compiled and deployed for you.</p>

<p>PaaS makes user management easy by providing development teams with privilege separation options, for example an ‘admin’ user will be able to assign other team members certain permissions from their PaaS console.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK PaaS is deployed to multiple availability zones, making it resilient.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK PaaS is accredited for information up to ‘official’. Refer to the <a href="/#data-security-classification">data security classification documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The platform itself is supported 24/7 by GDS, although this does not include application support.</p>

<p>Features of the PaaS platform currently include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>support for <a href="#deploy-a-backing-or-routing-service">multiple backing services</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>language support through the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/">standard Cloud Foundry buildpacks</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>limited support for custom buildpacks</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>support for public and private Docker images</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>ability to stream application logs to Software as a Service logging platforms</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="coding-in-the-open">Coding in the open</h3>

<p>We are making all new GOV.UK PaaS source code open and reusable. You can use our source code if you want to support a different backing service (any networked attached service that your application consumes to do its job, for example a PostgreSQL database).</p>
