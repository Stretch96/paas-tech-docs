<h1 id="configuring-a-continuous-integration-ci-tool">Configuring a continuous integration (CI) tool</h1>

<p>A continuous integration (CI) tool deploys software automatically to help you deliver new features without breaking existing functionality.</p>

<p>Examples of CI tools include <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/">Circle</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="choose-ci-tool">Choose CI tool</h2>

<p>You should choose a CI tool based on criteria such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>product features</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>support offered</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>pricing</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>security</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should focus on how the tool encrypts and protects any sensitive information or secrets such as keys, usernames or passwords. You are responsible for the <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/ia">assurance of your own services and information</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configure-your-ci-tool-accounts">Configure your CI tool accounts</h2>

<p>You should create one or more dedicated PaaS user accounts for use by your CI tool.</p>

<p>Use a different account for each <a href="/orgs_spaces_users.html#spaces">space</a> you want to deploy your app to using your CI tool.</p>

<p>Assign a <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html#users-and-user-roles">user role</a> to each of these accounts. These user roles should have the minimum permissions needed for setting up Travis to automatically build and deploy your app.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK PaaS will lock your credentials if your CI tool makes <a href="/troubleshooting.html#failed-login-rate-limit">multiple failed login attempts in a short period of time</a>.</p>
